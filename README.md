# PTFE Migration Modules

This repo contains a terraform module that has been specially crafted to be compatible with
the state generated by https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-enterprise-modules, allowing
for existing AMI based installation to be migration to installer based directly.

Please see https://www.terraform.io/docs/enterprise/private/simplified-migration.html for
instructions on using these terraform modules.

# Release Numbers

If you wish to pin the version that is automatically installed by an instance, here is a listing
of the release ids to release numbers. Within the tfvars file, you'll specify the release number
under the variable `release_number`. For example, `release_number = 291`.

## Table of release numbers

| Release Id | Release Number |
|------------|----------------|
| v201809-1  | 291            |
